# Khmer Number Recognition

This project is a **Khmer Handwritten Number Recognition** system that allows users to draw Khmer numbers (0-9) on a UI, and a trained model will predict the drawn number.

## Features
- **User Interface (UI):** Users can draw numbers using a graphical interface.
- **Machine Learning Model:** A convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on Khmer handwritten numbers.
- **Real-time Prediction:** The model predicts the number once the user finishes drawing.
- **Dataset Handling:** Includes preprocessing, training, and testing datasets.
